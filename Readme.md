This repository contains the code to generate a web app. The web app provides a basic interface to explore data downloaded from the "Centre for disease control and prevention" website (based on the survey data of the NHIS).

This web app was developed in order to fulfill the requirements of the "Data products" course, a course in the data-science specialisation on  Coursera.org.
